# Gram-Schmidt Calculator
A calculator for computing orthogonal and orthonormal bases in R^n. [Wikepidia description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process)

### Notes
* By default the vectors are in R^3 (3-vectors)
* An expansion of the numpy linalg library -- requires the pip installation of numpy.py

### Goals
* Build a more robust library out of this
