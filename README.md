# Gram-Schmidt Calculator
A calculator for computing orthogonal and orthonormal bases in R^n. [Wikepidia description of this process.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process)

### Notes
* By default the vectors are in R^3 (3-vectors). You may enter the vectors in the larger matrix (labeled as A), or as individual vectors if you'd prefer. There is already a built in algorithm to break up the columns, so it is likely easy to enter it as a nx3 matrix.
* This expands upon the numpy linalg library -- requires the pip installation of numpy.py

### Goals
* Build a more robust library out of this
